Ok, what do I learn so far :
- write a model to classify pictures
- save it
- fail to publish it (work for later)
- say no to non-ethicals demands
- be carreful with over fitting
- use fastai in the titanic comptetition on Kaggle
- use Github pages and fastpages for create this blog
- create a accompt on google analytics to reference this blog
- create a accompte on azure for use Bing on multiple pictures

On the deployement part, I have some ideas :
- Google Cloud
- pray for the integration of widget in fastpages
- write a site on Django and plug my model myself
- look again on he fastai courses if I can use there solutions

That's all for now !
