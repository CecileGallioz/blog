title: Part 1 on fastai book done!

Okay, what have I learned so far:
- write a template to sort images
- save it
- fail to publish it with a lot of tools (work for later)
- use DeepL to improve my written English
- say no to unethical requests
- be careful with over fitting
- use fastai in the Titanic competition on Kaggle (top 16%)
- use Github and fastpages to create this blog
- create an account on google analytics to reference this blog
- create an account on Azure to use Bing on several images

As for deploying a functional model on a web page, I have a few ideas:
- Google Cloud
- write a site on Django and integrate my template myself
- look again at the Fastai courses to see if I can manage to use their solutions.

That's all for now!
