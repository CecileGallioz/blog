My name is CÃ©cile Gallioz, I live in France with my husband and son.

After 15 years in business intelligence and requirements gathering, I am adding a string to my bow with Python development.

My goal is to develop tools to improve productivity and efficiency.

My values are creativity, transmission and integrity.

I have a master's degree in mathematical engineering and a bachelor's degree in computer development.
