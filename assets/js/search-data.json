            "content": "Useful information . Variables are not typed, while objects are. | . Variables address objects (strong typing). | . Variable names are best in camelCase (first letter in lower case and no numbers in first) and as meaningful as possible. | . In Python to identify a block of instructions, you need an identation of 4 spaces and not a tab | . Small immutable objects are sometimes stored as singletons (only one possible occurrence) | . Types of data . Type Example Immutable? Singleton? Notes . Integer | 1 | Immutable | Possible | No loss of accuracy | . Boolean | True ou False | Immutable | Possible | No loss of accuracy | . Float | 1.2 | Immutable | Possible | Possible loss of accuracy | . Complex | 1+2j | Immutable | Possible | Possible loss of accuracy | . String | &quot;blah&quot; or &#39;blah&#39; | Immutable | Possible | | . Tuple | ( ,) or ( , ,) or , | Immutable | Possible | | . | | | | | . List | [ , ] | Mutable | | Stores only the references | . Dictionary | { : , : } | Mutable | | Unordered and unchangeable keys/values | . Set | { , } | Mutable | | Unordered and unique immutable keys | . Operators . Operator Name Notes . = | Opérateur d&#39;affectation | | | | . # | Comments | | | | . | | | | | . + | Addition or concatenation | Int + Int = Int | Int + Float = Float | Text + Text = Text | . - | Subtraction | Int - Int = Int | Int - Float = Float | | . * | Multiplication | Int * Int = Int | Int * Float = Float | | . / | Division | Int / Int = Float | Int / Float = Float | | . | | | | | . % | Modulo | Subtract from division | | | . // | Whole division | Rounded down | | | . ** | Power | idem pow(a,b) | | | . | | | | | . str() | Cast in String | str(Int) = String | | | . int() | Cast in Int | int(Float) = Int | | | . float() | Cast in Float | float(Int) = Float | | | . | | | | | . += | Simultaneous addition and affection | | | | . -= | Simultaneous subtraction and affection | | | | . * = | Simultaneous multiplication and affection | | | | . /= | Simultaneous division and affection | | | | . f string give a string using variables . f&quot;blah-blah-blah {function1(variable1)} blah-blah-blah {function2(variable2)} blah-blah-blah&quot; . age = 45 name = &quot;Paul&quot; gap = 10 . f&quot;In {gap} year(s), {name} will be {age + gap} year(s) old.&quot; . &#39;In 10 year(s), Paul will be 55 year(s) old.&#39; . List (mutable) . nameList = [&quot;String&quot;, number, otherList, variable] . The list does not store the objects but only the reference to the object. Its size will not vary according to the size of the referenced objects. . The index starts at 0. . Unlike text, they are modified by their methods =&gt; they are mutable. . Order Description . myList.index(element) | Returns the index of the element | . | | . print(myList) | Displays the entire list | . len(myList) | Returns the length of a list | . myList.sort() | Changes myList into a sorted list instead | . sorted(myList) | Copy and sort myList | . | | . myList.append(element) | Adds the element to the end of the list | . myList.insert(index, element) | Add the element to the specified index and move the following elements by one index | . myList.extend([otherList]) | Add the list otherList to the end of the first one (myList) | . | | . myList.pop(index) | Delete and display the element with the index as argument or the last one | . maListe.remove(element) | Deletes the first occurrence of an element | . del myList[index] | Deletes the element at the specified index | . | | . myList[1] | Accesses the 2nd element of the list | . myList[-1] | Go to the last element of the list | . myList[1:3] | Accesses the 2nd and 3rd elements of the list | . | | . &quot; &quot;.join(myList) | Transforms a list into a character string according to the space separator, which is the opposite of split() | . | | . random.choice(myList) | choose an element from the list | . random.choices(myList,3) | choose 3 elements in the list with throw-in | . random.sample(myList,3) | choose 3 elements from the list without throw-in | . myList = [8, 5, 12, 4, 45, 7] . myList[1] = 5 sum(myList) = 81 max(myList) = 45 . myList = list(range(2)) . myList = [0, 1] . myList.append(2) . myList = [0, 1, 2] . myList.insert(1,&quot;one half&quot;) . myList = [0, &#39;one half&#39;, 1, 2] . myList = [3, 5, 7, 6, 4, 1, 0, 2] myList.sort() . myList = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7] . Tuple (immutable) . (element,) or element, =&gt; tuple singleton (element, element) or (element, element,) &lt;= for writing long tuples on several lines or element, element &lt;= for tuple unpacking or element, element, =&gt; multiple tuple . These are sequence objects. . They have the same properties as lists except that they are immutable =&gt; once created they cannot be modified. .
